LewisSystem: Modern Furniture E-commerce Platform🛋️ Project OverviewLewisSystem is a modern, full-stack e-commerce application designed for a furniture retail business. It provides a robust, scalable backend for managing product inventory, orders, and user accounts, coupled with a highly interactive and responsive front-end customer experience.Technology StackComponentTechnologyVersion / EnvironmentNotesBackend (API)ASP.NET Core.NET 10Handles business logic, data persistence, and RESTful API endpoints.Frontend (UI)React (with JavaScript)Latest StableProvides the dynamic user interface for browsing, searching, and purchasing.Backend IDEVisual Studio2026Used for managing the C# solution, debugging, and running the API.Frontend EditorVisual Studio CodeLatestUsed for developing the React user interface.🚀 Getting StartedThis project operates as two separate applications: the LewisSystem.Server (ASP.NET API) and the LewisSystem.ClientApp (React). Both must be running concurrently for the application to function locally. The frontend is configured to automatically proxy API requests to the running backend server.PrerequisitesYou must have the following installed on your system:Visual Studio 2026: Ensure the ASP.NET and web development workload is installed..NET 10 SDK: The required SDK version for the backend project.Node.js (LTS) & npm: Required for running the React frontend.Visual Studio Code: The recommended editor for front-end development.💻 1. Running the Backend (Visual Studio 2026)The ASP.NET API runs on a secure HTTPS port and serves as the data provider for the furniture store.Goal: Start the API server to handle requests (e.g., retrieving product lists, processing orders) and open Swagger documentation.Open the Solution:Open Visual Studio 2026.Go to File > Open > Project/Solution.Navigate to the root directory and select the LewisSystem.sln solution file.Restore Dependencies:Right-click on the solution in the Solution Explorer and select Restore NuGet Packages.Configure Startup Project:Right-click the LewisSystem.Server project in the Solution Explorer and select Set as Startup Project.(Note: This project is typically configured to proxy the frontend automatically, but for dedicated API debugging, this is the safest step.)Run the API:Press the Start Debugging button (the green arrow, or F5).Visual Studio will build the C# code and launch the API.A console window will open, displaying the backend's listening URL (e.g., https://localhost:7123). Make note of this URL/Port, as the frontend uses it for proxying.The API's Swagger UI should open automatically in your default browser, confirming the backend is operational.Keep Running:Keep this Visual Studio instance running while developing or testing the front-end.🎨 2. Running the Frontend (Visual Studio Code)The React application consumes the API endpoints provided by the backend.Goal: Start the React development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).Open the Client App:Open Visual Studio Code.Go to File > Open Folder....Navigate to the root of your project and select the LewisSystem.ClientApp directory.Install Node Modules:Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+` or Terminal > New Terminal).Run the installation command (this only needs to be done once):npm install
Start the React Development Server:In the same terminal, run the start command:npm run dev
The Vite development server will start (the template uses Vite for fast development).The terminal will display the local URL where the React application is running (e.g., http://localhost:5173).Access the Application:Open your browser and navigate to the local frontend URL (http://localhost:5173).The LewisSystem furniture store should load, communicating with the backend API running from Visual Studio 2026.🧪 Deployment & PublishingWhen ready to publish, the ASP.NET Core project is configured to automatically trigger the React build process (npm run build) and bundle the optimized static files into the server's build output.Build the Frontend for Production:In the LewisSystem.ClientApp directory, run npm run build.Publish the Backend (Includes Frontend):In Visual Studio 2026, right-click the LewisSystem.Server project.Select Publish... and choose your desired target (Azure, Folder, IIS, etc.).The final published output will contain both the compiled .NET assembly and the production-ready React static files, ready for hosting.
